# key-theatre

A LED controller for the Logitech G810 keyboard.

See **bin/x64/Release** or **bin/x86/Release** (according to your system) to download the executable file!

Note that your keyboard might be physically different due to the layout. This code was written with the French layout in mind but is easily adaptible; see KeyboardInfo.cs.

In theory, this program should work for other Logitech RGB keyboards as well, but don't expect the results to be perfect ;)

Used libraries:
- LED SDK 8.87 by Logitech

Used packages:
- Extended WPF Toolkit by Xceed
